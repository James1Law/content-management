# My Memory - Session Continuity Command

You are resuming work on a personal blog CMS project. Review the project state and propose the next steps.

## Instructions

1. **Read the changelog** at `CHANGELOG.md` to understand what was done in previous sessions

2. **Read the PRD** at `docs/PRD.md` to understand the full project requirements and check off completed items

3. **Check current project state** by examining:
   - What files/folders exist
   - What dependencies are installed (package.json)
   - What features are implemented vs pending

4. **Summarize for the user**:
   - What was last worked on
   - Current project status (% complete estimate)
   - Any blockers or decisions needed

5. **Propose next task(s)**:
   - Based on the PRD phases and what's already done

   - Ask if the user wants to proceed or do something else
